# Airbnb Paris — Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Project description
This project presents an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of Airbnb listings in Paris.
The main focus is on pricing patterns, differences between neighbourhoods, and selected
relationships such as price vs number of guests and trends over time.

The goal of the project is to demonstrate data cleaning, exploratory analysis, andclear communication of analytical insights using Python.

## Analysis overview
The notebook includes:
- data loading and inspection
- data cleaning and preparation
- exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- visualisation of key patterns
- discussion of findings

Key analytical questions:
- How do average prices differ between Paris neighbourhoods?
- How does listing price relate to the number of guests a property can accommodate?
- What trends can be observed in prices and host activity over time?

## Key findings
- Average listing prices vary significantly across neighbourhoods.
- Listings accommodating more guests tend to have higher prices, although the relationship is not strictly linear.
- Time-based analysis shows visible trends in both pricing and host activity.
